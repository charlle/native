### Immigration
The United States has had a long history of welcoming immigrants from all parts of the world since its founding. The contributions brought by those same immigrants have expanded the culture of The United States, and continue to enrich the country as a land of freedom and opportunity. 

Deciding to become a U.S. citizen is one of the most important decisions in an individualâ€™s life. If you decide to apply to become a U.S. citizen, you will be showing your commitment to the United States and The United States Constitution.
