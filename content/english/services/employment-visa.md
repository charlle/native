### Employment Visa
The hiring of foreign workers has become an important business need in the United States. Our immigration laws allow companies to hire and sponsor foreigners to work and live in the United States. TMCT can help you compile information and demonstrate your eligibility for an Employment Visa. 

Employment Visa's are generally for <i>temporary</i> workers, who do not intend to be permanent residents of the United States. 

In most employment categories, your U.S. employer will be deemed a sponsor, and you will be considered the beneficiary. Those employment categories can be recognized as EB-1,EB-2,EB-3,and EB-4. Your employer will need to complete, file and get approval of a labor certification request and an immigrant visa petition. TMCT cannot stress enough how important it is to make sure that there are no mistakes in the paperwork. Any error can delay approval of your visa petition or cause it to be denied altogether. After you have completed the first two steps explained above, you will wait in line among other foreign nationals seeking visas in the same employment category. The “priority date” determines where your place in line is. Once you get to the head of the line, you will be assigned a case number for your employment-based visa. You will then need to submit more forms and documents, including medical examination/vaccine records.

If you are already in the U.S., you will need to apply to adjust to permanent resident status after your visa number becomes available. If you are outside the U.S. when your number becomes available, you will be notified and must complete the process at your local U.S. consulate office. Keep in mind that this process will include a visa interview. The immigration attorneys at TMCT can clarify these laws for you and determine whether your potential employee qualifies. TMCT will do everything within its power to get a green card or visa approved ending possible.
