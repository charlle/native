### Mediation
Based on years of professional experience, mediation is the smartest and most efficient means of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Protracted litigation can financially damage a business and ruin commercial relationships.  As third-party neutrals, mediators guide the parties away from the conflict inherent in time-consuming litigation, and towards a mutually acceptable settlement so the parties can continue with their personal and professional productivity. We assist clients in disputes to reach an equitable arrangement and logical resolution, in order to avoid costly, time-consuming litigation. Our unique model of mediation adhered to has achieved wide acclaim with a reported eighty-five percent (85%) success rate, reaching settlements that perservere.
