### Permanent Resident
We have the experience necessary to represent our clients before state, federal and governmental agencies. The immigration rules are constantly in review, but our legal team in TMCT offers professional expertise to deliver the best results. TMCT provides solutions to live, work and invest in the United States. We can also provide assistance with applications for work authorization, permanent residency, and naturalization. Foreign nationals who have been legally admitted to the United States and continue to maintain their legal status, may change their immigration status from one category status to another, without having to return back to their country of origin to complete visa processing. Technically called lawful permanent residence, a green card is one of the most sought-after legal documents in the immigration field. As you probably know, however, getting a green card isn't easy. The U.S. immigration system is one of the most complicated in the world. Depending on your situation, the process could take years.
 
For example, if you legally entered the country on a non-immigrant B1/B2 tourist visa, and later meet and marry a citizen of the U.S, you are allowed to stay in the U.S. while applying for an Adjustment of Status to attain Permanent Resident (Green Card) status by meeting certain requirements.

#### Qualifying for a Green Card
Through a family member: One of the most common pathways to permanent residence is through a spouse, parent, adult child, sibling or other close relative. In domestic violence situations, you may be able to petition on your own, without needing to involve an abusive spouse or family member.

Through a U.S. employer: Employers have the ability to sponsor employees. However, the law imposes strict criteria and processes for employment-based green cards.

Through asylum: If you suffered persecution (or credible threats of persecution) in your home country, you may be eligible for a green card through asylum. You must show you were persecuted because of your race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion.

Through the diversity visa lottery: Nationals of certain countries may be eligible to apply for the visa lottery, which takes place every year.

Our legal team at TMCT also recognizes the legal barriers that can prevent you from adjusting your status. If you entered the United States using one of the following visa categories you may be barred from adjusting your status and will be asked to leave the country.
