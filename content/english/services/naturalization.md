### Naturalization
If you would like to apply for U.S. citizenship, our legal team at TMCT can help you. If you have a green card and want to apply for citizenship, TMCT can assist you with your case.

#### Applying for US Citizenship
- You are a lawful U.S. permanent resident
- You are at least 18 years old
- You have continuously resided in the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 years (or 3 years if you are married to a U.S. citizen)
- You have lived in the state where you will file for naturalization for at least 3 months
- You will live in the U.S. from the date you file your naturalization application until the date you receive citizenship
- In addition to these requirements, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may look for other requirements. You will also be required to pass an examination that demonstrates a basic understanding of English language, in reading and writing, as well as a basic knowledge of the U.S. government history. The examination is called The Naturalization Test.
