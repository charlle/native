### Profile
I am a proven leader in technology, business, and combat.  I’ve spent two careers building highly specialized teams to undertake incredibly challenging projects.  I’ve scaled business values and technology platforms to handle 1,000% growth.  I’ve commanded 156 marines across two continents with a $24 million budget and built whole engineering operations for publicly traded companies.  I lead by example and love to get my hands dirty.

Having spent the majority of my professional career focused on technology startups, I’m a passionate engineer.  I have managed and engineered whole cloud based web and mobile application systems for millions of users.  I’ve recruited, trained, and built engineering teams; established processes, development cycles, version control systems, and best practices; and, know multiple programming languages and technologies throughout the stack.

With a strong operational background, I’m biased towards action, efficiency, and results.   I’ve managed and produced operational plans for organizations with 10,000 people accounting for dozens of departments and specialties.   And, I’ve built operations for large business from scratch.  I’m an ardent practitioner of data-driven processes and employing small cross-functional teams.

Experienced Executive, Entrepreneur, & Consultant.  Full Stack Software Engineer.  Web & Mobile Product Developer.  Strong Leadership Background.  Marine Corps Major.  University of Pennsylvania graduate.
