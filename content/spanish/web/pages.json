		"M1": "Modern web browsers support modular, componentized JavaScript natively. Native Js gives you the power of a front end framework without the overhead. Web components have the natural advantage of fast load times and portability to any application. You can even dynamically import functions the way React and Angular do it.",
		"H2": "No Builds Required",
		"M2": "Immediately eliminate the headache of building and deploying your code. Native Js enables you to simply code and commit. Since everything is native to the web browser, you can test and debug your web application without running a server.",
		"H3": "Free Hosting",
		"M3": "When your ready to deploy simply commit your code to GitHub, no build required. Using free services, like GitHub Pages, your changes will automatically be live. No more setting up and maintaining servers."

		"M1": "Native Js relies on the core languages and technologies we leverage everyday without any added fluff, bloat, or complexity. We believe in keeping things really simple... fast and efficient. You don't need anything more than HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and your Browser",

		"valM1": "JavaScript Classes may be only a syntactical change for the language, but we are super happy they made it, giving us the immediate familiarity of many object orientated languages. Thank you!!",
		"valH2": "Modules",
		"valM2": "ES6 released built in modules, allowing you to import and export JavaScript functions, which was quickly supported in all major browsers. You can easily abstract your code into components and libraries.",
		"valH3": "Async + Await",
		"valM3": "Every new release keeps getting better. ES7 brought us a better implementation of Promises, Async & Await. Adding Async to your functions and classes makes them soooo much easier to write. No more messy callbacks or nested functions.",	
		"recH": "Recognized Leader",
		"recM": "With extremely high throughput and naturally asynchronous, JavaScript was built for speed. It has many benefits to offer any application. While it has dominated the Web for many years, it is quickly becoming the language of choice for both Mobile apps and API services.",
